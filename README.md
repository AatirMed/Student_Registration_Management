The code is a console application to manage student registrations in different fields and groups.

It provides the following functionality:

- Adding a new student (with basic information such as name, email, phone number).
= Editing the information of an existing student.
- Removing an existing student from the list.
- Displaying a list of all the registered students.
- Displaying all the registered students in a specific field.
- Displaying all the registered students in a specific group.

The application uses a few lists of dictionaries to store the students' information, the fields, and the groups. The registration of a student is made by adding a dictionary object with the necessary fields to the "inscription_list" list. The dictionary object includes the student ID, the field ID, the group ID, and the registration date.

The console interface is simple and easy to use, providing a clean and straightforward menu for the user to choose the desired action. The code also includes some utility functions for clearing the console screen and printing the output in a controlled way.

Some features could be added to improve the application, such as input validation, error handling, and better user feedback. Overall, the application is a good starting point for a small-scale student registration management system.
